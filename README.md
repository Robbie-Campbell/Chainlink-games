#### :tada: Hello gentlemens! Welcome to our first working repository! :tada:

:construction: **Obviously this repo is likely to end up being a _bit_ messy, but I have an idea of how we can approach this in a relatively efficient way!** :construction:

1. There are _multiple_ branches to use in this repo, I have tried to name them in meaningful ways. But if there is any confusion on which branch to make pull requests to it honestly isn't the end of the world!

2. If you have any trouble familiarizing yourself with github and how to use it! Have no fear! We all do! _if you could extend the same courtesy to me... that would be great!_

3. When you do make commits to branches make sure your commit messages are __meaningful__! Furthermore, try and summarise in the commit and if necessary elaborate in the commit description.

## :wrench: BUT IT IS A LEARNING CURVE :wrench:
##### Let's have fun with it guys, I will update the readme as necessary, but i think this a good start!

# :shipit: Let's Go! :shipit:

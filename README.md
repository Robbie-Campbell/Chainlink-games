#### :tada: Hello gentlemens! Welcome to our first working repository! :tada:

:construction: **Obviously this repo is likely to end up being a _bit_ messy, but I have an idea of how we can approach this in a relatively efficient way!** :construction:

1. There are _multiple_ branches to use in this repo, I have tried to name them in meaningful ways. But if there is any confusion on which branch to make pull requests to, it isn't the end of the world because it all ends up in the same place eventually!

2. If you have any trouble familiarizing yourself with github and how to use it! Have no fear! We all do! _if you could extend the same courtesy to me... that would be great, this is my first group GH project too!_

3. When you do make commits to branches make sure your commit messages are __meaningful__! Furthermore, try and summarise briefly in the commit __then__ elaborate in the commit description where necessary.

4. Any tasks that need to be completed should be raised as an "issue" in the "issues" tab of the github repository, this will automatically be added to the project todo list. You can also assign timescales and who to is part of the implementation process of the issue in question. _This is new to me, so once again bear with me!_

5. Finally, try and keep the actual unity project as neat as possible, here are 2 examples:
      > If you make a new sound effect - place it in the correct unity audio folder
  
      > If you have a new animator object but no folder for it yet exists - create one and name the animator        meaningfully so we both know where to find it and what exactly the animator is for.

## :wrench: BUT IT IS A LEARNING CURVE :wrench:
##### Let's have fun with it guys, I will update the readme as necessary, but i think this a good start!

# :shipit: Let's Go! :shipit:
